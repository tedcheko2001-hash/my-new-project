# AI pet identifier

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

SmartRoute Optimizer is an AI-powered solution designed to find the most efficient routes between multiple destinations while considering constraints such as traffic, fuel costs, and time. It helps reduce travel time, save resources, and improve decision-making. Building AI course project.


## Background

**Problem:** Pet misclassification is surprisingly common, especially in shelters, veterinary clinics, and for new pet owners. Mistakes in identifying pets can lead to improper care, feeding, and record-keeping.
**How common?** Globally, millions of cats and dogs live in shelters, and correct identification is crucial for adoption, vaccination, and treatment.
**Personal motivation:** I am motivated by my interest in AI for real-world classification tasks and the importance of ensuring animals are properly cared for.
**Why it matters:** This project is a small but meaningful demonstration of how AI can automate classification and help in both daily life (apps for pet owners) and institutional settings (animal shelters, vet clinics).


This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

- **Users:** Animal shelters, veterinarians, or even mobile app users.
- **Context:** When someone inputs pet measurements, the system outputs the predicted pet type.
- **Impact:** Helps reduce misidentification errors and standardizes data for records.


Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
